Nonparametric regression

This package implements various nonparametric regression techniques, including the local average, Nadaraya-Watson, and local polynomial estimators, with bandwidth selection via cross-validation. 

It is mostly intended to support the course MATH4/68011 Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression, at the University of Manchester.
